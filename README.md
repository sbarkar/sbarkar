I am an entrepreneur, currently the CEO of Transparency as a Service AG, with almost a decade of experience designing scalable, reliable and cost-effective data solutions behind my back. Besides my pure developer duties, I build my own products and services and advocate for a strong culture among peers whether through my blog or speaking at various events.

Being a genuinely curious individual, I always keep an eye on challenging problems I could help solve. I’d love to hear from you if yours is one of those. Want to get in touch? No problem! Please find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sbarkar_). Follow me right away or send me a direct message. I am also on [Telegram](https://t.me/sbarkar), [Medium](https://medium.com/@sbarkar), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbarkar/).
