I am a data platform architect with around half a decade behind my back, designing scalable, reliable and cost effective data analytics solutions. Besides my pure developer duties, I build my own products and services, and advocate for a strong culture among peers whether through my blog, or speaking at various events.

Being a genuinely curious individual, I always keep an eye on challenging problems I could help solve. If yours is one of those, Iâ€™d love to hear from you. Want to get in touch? No problem! Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sbarkar_). Follow right away or send me a direct message. I am also on [Telegram](https://t.me/sbarkar), [Medium](https://medium.com/@sbarkar), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbarkar/).
